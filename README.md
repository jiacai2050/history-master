# Notice

Due to [limitation of history search API](https://github.com/jiacai2050/history-master/issues/24), this extension cannot display histories day after day correctly, this is why there are so many issues reporting numbers are wrong.

So I decide to archive this project, if you like this project, you can try my another project: [1History](https://github.com/1History/1History), which share same design with history-master. 

1History overcame limitation of extension API by query history directly on SQLite files created by browsers, so everything is under control, and works as expected.

## Development

History Master is written in pure JavaScript before v2.0.0, you can check this version at [legacy-js-src](legacy-js-src).

Afterwards, it's got a big rewrite in [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) + [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) + [Re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) + [Ant.design](https://ant.design/)Ôºåwhich locates in [cljs-src](cljs-src).

Since it's written in cljs, so [lein](https://leiningen.org/) is required to develop this extension. To get the final release version, run [release.sh](./cljs-src/release.sh) script, it will generate a zip file in your home directory.

- [extensions](https://github.com/jiacai2050/better-history/tree/extensions) branch used for Firefox/Chrome extensions, thanks to [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions) -- Write once, Run All browsers.
